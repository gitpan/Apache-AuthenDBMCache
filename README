This module, Apache::AuthenDBMCache, is an Apache/mod_perl authentication
handler to accelerate logins that use other perl methods (like AuthenURL,
AuthenSMB, or etc.). It requires Apache support for the stacking of modules
(which has been there for quite some time).

To build and install it, please run

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install

To read more about this module try

    pod2text AuthenDBMCache.pm 

In many ways this is just another implementation of AuthenCache but instead of
using shared memory I use a DBM file to cache data. We were using the shared
memory method but ran into problems when the cache filled. There are other
issues.

BEWARE: If you want to use this module the system manager will have to have
        set up the cache file and a cron job to prune the cache. See the POD.
